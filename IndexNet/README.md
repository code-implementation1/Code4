## [IndexNet Description](#contents)

Upsampling is an essential stage for most dense prediction tasks using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
The frequently used upsampling operators include transposed convolution, unpooling, periodic shuffling
(also known as depth-to-space), and naive interpolation followed by convolution.
These operators, however, are not general-purpose designs and often exhibit different behaviors in different tasks.
Instead of using maxpooling and unpooling, IndexNet is based on two novel operations: indexed pooling and indexed upsampling
where downsampling and upsampling are guided by learned indices. The indices are generated dynamically conditioned
on the feature map and are learned using a fully convolutional network, termed IndexNet, without supervision.

[Paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Lu_Indices_Matter_Learning_to_Index_for_Deep_Image_Matting_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf):  Indices Matter: Learning to Index for Deep Image Matting. Hau Lu, Yutong Dai, Chunhua Shen.

## [Model Architecture](#contents)

IndexNet bases on the UNet architecture and uses mobilenetv2 as backbone.
Mobilenetv2 was chosen because it is lightweight and allows the use of higher-resolution images on the same GPU as high capacity backbones.
All 2-stride convolutions were changed by 1-stride convolutions and 2-stride 2x2 max poolings after each encoding stage for downsampling, which allows the extraction of indices.
If applying the IndexNet idea, max pooling and unpooling layers can be replaced with IndexedPooling and IndexedUnpooling, respectively.

## [Dataset](#contents)

Paper uses the Adobe Image Matting dataset, but it is in close access.
Thus, we use AIM-500 (Automatic Image Matting - 500) dataset, which is in open access, and anyone can download it.

Every image from AIM-500 dataset cuts out by mask and N (96 train part, 20 test part) times placed as foreground
over the unique image from the COCO-2014 dataset (train part), which is used as background.

Datasets used: AIM-500, COCO-2014 (train).

|               | AIM-500                                          | COCO-2014             | Merged (after processing) |
| --------------|------------------------------------------------- |---------------------- |-------------------------- |
| Dataset size  | ~0.35 Gb                                         | ~13.0 Gb              | ~86.0 Gb                  |
| Train         | 0.35 Gb, 3 * 500 images (mask, original, trimap) | 13.0 Gb, 82783 images | 84 Gb, 43200 images       |
| Test          | -                                                | -                     | 2 Gb, 1000 images         |
| Data format   | .png, .jpg images                                | .jpg images           | .png images               |

Note: We manually split AIM-500 for the train/test parts (450/50).

Download [AIM-500](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IyPiYJUp-KtOoa-Hsm922VU3aCcidjjz) dataset
(3 folders: original, mask, trimap), unzip them, move folders from unzipped archives into one folder named AIM-500.
Download [COCO-2014 train](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2014.zip) and unzip.

The structure of the datasets will be as follows:

```text
.
└─AIM-500      <- data_dir
  ├─mask
  │ └─***.png
  ├─original
  │ └─***.jpg
  └─trimap
    └─***.png

.
└─train2014    <- bg_dir
  └─***.jpg

Where *** is the image file name
```

To process dataset use the command below.

```bash
python -m data.process_dataset --data_dir /path/to/AIM-500 --bg_dir /path/to/coco/train2014
```

- DATA_DIR - path to image matting dataset (AIM-500 folder, in this case).
- BG_DIR - path to backgrounds dataset (COCO/train2014 folder, in this case).

Note: Before data processing requirements will be installed. Make sure that you have ~100 Gb free space at disk,
which corresponds to --data_dir path. It can take about 20 hours to prepare dataset, depends on hardware.

During processing the data_dir structure will be automatically changed and
the merged images saved into data_dir/train/merged, data_dir/validation/merged. The bg_dir will remain unchanged.
Processed dataset will have the following structure:

```text
.
└─AIM-500      <- data_dir
  ├─train
  │ ├─data.txt
  │ ├─mask
  │ ├─merged
  │ └─original
  └─validation
    ├─data.txt
    ├─mask
    ├─merged
    ├─original
    └─trimap

.
└─train2014    <- bg_dir
```
