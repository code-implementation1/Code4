# [HiFaceGAN Description](#table-of-contents)

HiFaceGAN is a novel method for a for photo-realistic face restoration under a “dual-blind” condition, lifting the requirements
of both the degradation and structural prior for training. The network architecture is based on collaborative suppression and
replenishment (CSR) blocks. In the suppression module, content-adaptive filters are used instead of usual convolutions. In the
replenishment module, spatial adaptive denormalization (SPADE) blocks are used, where each block receives the output from the
previous block and replenishes new details following the guidance of the corresponding semantic features encoded with the suppression
module. In this way, HiFaceGAN can automatically capture the global structure and progressively fill in finer visual details at
proper locations even without the guidance of additional face parsing information.

Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real face images verified the versatility, robustness and generalization capability
of the HiFaceGAN.

# [Dataset](#table-of-contents)

Dataset used: [Flickr-Faces-HQ Dataset (FFHQ, FLICKR)](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset)

Dataset size: 19.5G，15000 1024*1024 JPG images

- Train: 10000 images (first 10000 images, folders 00000-09000)
- Test: 5000 images (image folders 65000-69000)

To download FLICKR dataset, follow these steps:

- Clone [this repository](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset)
- Download manually [ffhq-dataset-v2.json](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16N0RV4fHI6joBuKbQAoG34V_cQk7vxSA) into the repository folder (for some reason the standard script cannot download this file)
- Launch the download script:

  ```bash
  python download_ffhq.py --json --images
  ```

This command downloads full FLICKR dataset (70000 png images in total). However, we only use 15000 of them.
You can modify the script to download only these 15000 files if you like or simply remove unnecessary files.
After that, move the contents of the folder `images1024x1024` into the dataset folder with name FLICKR.
You will get the overall structure of the dataset as follows (each directory containing 1000 png images):

```text
FLICKR
├── 00000/
├── 01000/
├── ...
├── 68000/
└── 69000/
```

Before training or running evaluation, install required packages from `research/cv/HiFaceGAN/`:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And preprocess images using image_preprocess.py script:

```shell
# Preprocess images for train phase
python src/dataset/image_preprocess.py /path/to/FLICKR train full 0 9
# Preprocess images for test (eval) phase
python src/dataset/image_preprocess.py /path/to/FLICKR test full 65 69
```

In this example, the images from directories [00000, 09000] and [65000, 69000] will be augmented and placed into
`/path/to/FLICKR/train_full` and `/path/to/FLICKR/test_full` respectively.

The directory structure after preprocessing:

```text
FLICKR
├── 00000/
├── 01000/
├── ...
├── 68000/
├── 69000/
├── test_full/
└── train_full/
```

```

# [Training and evaluation](#table-of-contents)

Go to the directory `research/cv/HiFaceGAN/`, and after installing MindSpore through the official website, you can follow the steps below for training and evaluation:

- Training on GPU

  ```shell
  # Standalone training
  bash scripts/run_standalone_train_gpu.sh [DATA_PATH] [VGG_PATH]
  # Multi-GPU training
  bash scripts/run_distributed_train_gpu.sh [RANK_SIZE] [DATA_PATH] [VGG_PATH]
  ```

  Here VGG_PATH is the location of the pretrained VGG19 network checkpoint. We used the official [checkpoint from MindSporeHub](https://download.mindspore.cn/model_zoo/r1.3/vgg19_gpu_v130_cifar10_research_cv_bs64_acc93.75/).

  Example:

  ```shell
  # Standalone training
  bash scripts/run_standalone_train_gpu.sh /path/to/FLICKR /path/to/vgg.ckpt
  # Multi-GPU training
  bash scripts/run_distributed_train_gpu.sh 8 /path/to/FLICKR /path/to/vgg.ckpt
  ```

- Evaluation on GPU

  ```shell
  bash scripts/run_eval_gpu.sh [DATA_PATH] [CKPT_PATH] [NUM_CHECKPOINTS](optional)
  ```

  Here CKPT_PATH is a path to a directory with generator checkpoints. The metric is calculated for each of the last few checkpoints.
  The number of checkpoints can be set through the optional variable NUM_CHECKPOINTS (default is 5).
  As a result of running the script, the images for the best checkpoint will be saved.

  Example:

  ```shell
  bash scripts/run_eval_gpu.sh /path/to/FLICKR /path/to/checkpoints/
  ```

  If you want to validate only one checkpoint, place it into an individual directory. Then run the above command specifying the path to this directory.

- Training results will have the following form:

  ```text
  Epoch[50] [900/1250] step cost: 622.28 ms, G_loss: 7.85, D_loss: 0.13, G_vgg_loss: 2.27, G_gan_loss: 0.61, G_gan_feat_loss: 4.96, D_fake_loss: 0.11, D_real_loss: 0.02
  Epoch[50] [1000/1250] step cost: 621.89 ms, G_loss: 10.84, D_loss: 0.04, G_vgg_loss: 3.10, G_gan_loss: 0.93, G_gan_feat_loss: 6.80, D_fake_loss: 0.02, D_real_loss: 0.02
  Epoch[50] [1100/1250] step cost: 621.97 ms, G_loss: 10.26, D_loss: 0.18, G_vgg_loss: 3.54, G_gan_loss: 1.06, G_gan_feat_loss: 5.66, D_fake_loss: 0.02, D_real_loss: 0.16
  Epoch[50] [1200/1250] step cost: 622.82 ms, G_loss: 7.76, D_loss: 0.38, G_vgg_loss: 3.00, G_gan_loss: 0.27, G_gan_feat_loss: 4.49, D_fake_loss: 0.26, D_real_loss: 0.12
  Epoch [50] total cost: 778947.18 ms, per step: 623.16 ms, G_loss: 9.04, D_loss: 0.23
  ========== end training ===============
  ```

- Evaluation results will have the following form:

  ```text
  Metrics for the best checkpoint: PSNR = 24.1509, SSIM = 0.6486
  Start generating images for the best checkpoint...
  Save generated images at ./results/predict
  total cost 59.76 min
  ========== end predict ===============

# [Description of Random Situation](#table-of-contents)

 Use set_global_seed function to set a random state. Note that the result of training and evaluation depends
 on dataset augmentations performed by imgaug library and is therefore device dependent.
